                When it comes to african elephants and people, the relationship is not easy. There is a conflict between the two due to crop raiding and death to humans because of elephants. The animals can easily cause damage that amounts to over thousands of dollars. Along with this, everyday elephants continue to be killed because of their ivory tusks and habitat degradation. There is question as to if the African Elephant will be able to be domesticated like its Asian cousins to help aid the relationship between them and humans. However they are not as easily domesticated due to their natural instincts.

                Where do they Live?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Mainly determined by food, the African Bush Elephant lives mostly in the savanna grasslands. Along with this, they can be also found in partial desert areas. With the ability to adapt to its environments it even lives in places like like the rainforest.

                Protecting the African Bush Elephant
            </h2>
            <p>
                According to The Nature Conservancy website, this humble animal requires large amounts of food and forage to survive. Due to habitat destruction and inability to resupply these demands, there is a threat to the elephant's survival. In addition there is major poaching that accompanies this specific type of bread leading to the loss of about 25,000 African Bush Elephants every year. Through community support, habitat conserving, and increasing security the safty of these animals can be achieved.
